# openbimmer
Openbimmer is meant to be a community driven project for maintaining bmw cars.
Main focus is on 3d printing classic parts which are either very expensive or out of stock and produciton.

## files and folders
Currently only 3D printable parts are available here.
Hopefully the other sections will get filled soon as well.

```bash
── openbimmer
